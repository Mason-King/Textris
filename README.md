# 🧩 Textris

**Stack letters. Build words. Clear the board.**  

Word Tetris combines the fast-paced action of falling blocks with the brain-teasing challenge of word puzzles. Letters drop from above — your job is to place them wisely and form words across the board.  

- 🟩 **Stack & Match**: Drop letters into place and connect them into words.  
- 🔡 **Clear the Board**: Every valid word you make disappears, scoring points and freeing space.  
- ⚡ **Power Tiles**: Use bombs, wildcards, and multipliers for big combos.  
- 🎯 **Multiple Modes**: Play endless survival, timed challenges, or daily puzzles.  
- 🏆 **Compete & Climb**: Chase high scores, unlock achievements, and challenge friends.  

Easy to pick up, hard to master — every drop matters. Can you keep the board clear and climb to word mastery?
